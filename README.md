## Available Scripts

### `npm start`

Starts the development server for the React application. This command compiles the React code and serves it usually at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

### `npm run build`

Compiles the React application into static files for production. The compiled version is optimized for performance and ready to be deployed.

### `npm run test`

Runs the test runner. It's set up to execute tests written for the React components or other JavaScript code in the project.

### `npm run eject`

Ejects the project, copying all build configs and dependencies (like webpack, Babel, ESLint) directly into the project for full control. Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you canâ€™t go back!

### `npm run lint`

Runs [ESLint](https://eslint.org/), a tool for identifying and reporting on patterns in JavaScript, across all `.js` and `.jsx` files  in the `src` directory. It helps in maintaining code quality and consistency.

### `npm run lint:fix`

Similar to the lint script, but it also automatically fixes problems that [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) can correct by itself. This is useful for quickly fixing common code discrepancies.

### `npm run format`

Runs [Prettier](https://prettier.io/), a code formatter, on all `.js` and `.jsx` files in the `src` directory. Prettier rewrites the code into a consistent style, which helps in maintaining a clean and readable codebase.

## Client Dependencies

### `@nextui-org/react`

A modern React UI library for building beautifully designed and customizable UI components.

### `@testing-library/jest-dom`

An extension for the [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) testing framework. It provides a set of custom matchers to extend Jest. These matchers help you test the state of your application's Document Object Model (DOM) more expressively and cleanly in your React applications.

### `@testing-library/react`

Part of the Testing Library suite, specifically designed for testing React components. It provides light utility functions on top of [react-dom](https://legacy.reactjs.org/docs/react-dom.html) and [react-dom/test-utils](https://legacy.reactjs.org/docs/test-utils.html), enabling more efficient work with DOM nodes in your tests.

### `@testing-library/user-event`

This library simulates real user interactions in tests. It allows simulating mouse clicks, keyboard text input, form submissions, and other events to test how your React components respond to user actions.

### `framer-motion`

A powerful library for React that makes it easy to add animations and transitions to your web application. It provides simple yet flexible APIs to elegantly animate your UI components.

### `react`

The core library of React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. Known for its efficient and flexible approach to creating interactive UIs in web applications.

### `react-dom`

This package serves as the entry point to the DOM for React. It provides DOM-specific methods that can be used at the top level of your app for efficient DOM element management in a web page.

### `react-router-dom`

A version of React Router tailored specifically for web browsers. It includes hooks for easy integration of routing into your React application, aiding in navigation, dynamic routing, and component rendering based on URL.

### `react-scripts`

Included in the Create React App toolkit, `react-scripts` is a set of scripts and configurations that simplify the complex build and setup process for React apps. It abstracts away intricate details of configurations for tools like Webpack, Babel, and ESLint, allowing developers to focus more on writing code rather than setting up environments.

### `web-vitals`

This library provides a way to measure performance metrics of a web page. It assists in capturing, analyzing, and monitoring real user experiences and key metrics that impact users' perception of site speed and usability.

## Client Development Dependencies

### `eslint-config-prettier`

An [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) configuration that disables rules conflicting with [Prettier](https://prettier.io/). It ensures ESLint and Prettier work together seamlessly, especially important for projects using both for code quality and formatting.

### `prettier`

[Prettier](https://prettier.io/) is an opinionated code formatter that enforces a consistent style across your codebase. It supports many languages and frameworks and integrates with most editors, formatting code to adhere to a consistent style.

### `tailwindcss`

[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) is a utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom user interfaces. It offers a wide range of classes for directly composing unique designs in your markup, mainly used during development for styling.
