## Available Scripts

### `npm start`

Starts the development server for the React application. This command compiles the React code and serves it usually at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

### `npm run build`

Compiles the React application into static files for production. The compiled version is optimized for performance and ready to be deployed.

### `npm run test` 

Runs the test runner. It's set up to execute tests written for the React components or other JavaScript code in the project.

### `npm run lint`

Runs ESLint, a tool for identifying and reporting on patterns in JavaScript, across all `.js` files in the project. It helps in maintaining code quality and consistency.

### `npm run lint:fix`

Similar to the lint script, but it also automatically fixes problems that ESLint can correct by itself. This is useful for quickly fixing common code discrepancies.

### `npm run format`

Runs [Prettier](https://www.npmjs.com/package/prettier), a code formatter, on all .js files. Prettier rewrites the code into a consistent style, which helps in maintaining a clean and readable codebase.
